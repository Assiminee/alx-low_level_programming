## This directory contains various C files that demonstrate basic programming concepts in C, particularly focusing on variables, if-else conditions, and while loops.

### [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
A C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

### [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
A C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and tells if it's greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

### [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

### [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters e and q, followed by a new line.

### [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

### [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)
A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space.

### [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)
A C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/Assiminee/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)
A C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
